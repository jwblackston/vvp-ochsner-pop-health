This is a common challenge in imbalanced classification and would be addressed through threshold optimization and calibration in a production setting.\n\nThis model offers a prototype framework that could inform tiered outreach strategies under value-based care, pending validation with real patient data.\n\n\nCost Savings & ROI Estimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated ROI: Targeted Care Management Program\n\n\nPatients Targeted\nAvg Cost (Est.)\nEst.

These individuals share patterns of elevated utilization (e.g., repeat admissions), low-to-moderate medication adherence, and higher overall risk scores.\nTargeted care management—such as intensive case reviews or social work referrals—could help reduce unnecessary admissions and improve adherence, supporting both cost containment and clinical outcomes.\nThis micro-level lens highlights how predictive modeling informs actionable, patient-level decisions under value-based care.\n\n\nStrategic Implications\nThis analysis demonstrates how predictive analytics can enable targeted care management and improve performance under value-based care agreements. By identifying high-risk patients in advance, our team might be able to:\n\nReduce preventable admissions and emergency department visits\nAllocate care coordination resources more efficiently\nQuantify and track impact on total cost of care\nAlign operational priorities with population health goals\n\nThe risk model provides a scalable foundation for tiered interventions, prospective outreach, and continuous ROI measurement—all aligned with the analytics and leadership responsibilities of the AVP role.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis project highlights a practical and scalable approach to value-based performance optimization. If I were serving this team with access to real patient data, this framework could be piloted and adapted to Ochsner’s specific contracts, care models, and operational realities.\nI look forward to your consideration and talking soon."

These individuals share patterns of elevated utilization (e.g., repeat admissions), low-to-moderate medication adherence, and higher overall risk scores.\nTargeted care management—such as intensive case reviews or social work referrals—could help reduce unnecessary admissions and improve adherence, supporting both cost containment and clinical outcomes.\nThis micro-level lens highlights how predictive modeling informs actionable, patient-level decisions under value-based care.\n\n\nStrategic Implications\nThis analysis demonstrates how predictive analytics can enable targeted care management and improve performance under value-based care agreements. By identifying high-risk patients in advance, our team might be able to:\n\nReduce preventable admissions and emergency department visits\nAllocate care coordination resources more efficiently\nQuantify and track impact on total cost of care\nAlign operational priorities with population health goals\n\nThe risk model provides a scalable foundation for tiered interventions, prospective outreach, and continuous ROI measurement—all aligned with the analytics and leadership responsibilities of the AVP role.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis project highlights a practical and scalable approach to value-based performance optimization. If I were serving this team with access to real patient data, this framework could be piloted and adapted to Ochsner’s specific contracts, care models, and operational realities.\nI look forward to your consideration and talking soon."

This is a common challenge in imbalanced classification and would be addressed through threshold optimization and calibration in a production setting.\n\nThis model offers a prototype framework that could inform tiered outreach strategies under value-based care, pending validation with real patient data.\n\n\nCost Savings & ROI Estimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated ROI: Targeted Care Management Program\n\n\nPatients Targeted\nAvg Cost (Est.)\nEst.

These individuals share patterns of elevated utilization (e.g., repeat admissions), low-to-moderate medication adherence, and higher overall risk scores.\nTargeted care management—such as intensive case reviews or social work referrals—could help reduce unnecessary admissions and improve adherence, supporting both cost containment and clinical outcomes.\nThis micro-level lens highlights how predictive modeling informs actionable, patient-level decisions under value-based care.\n\n\nStrategic Implications\nThis analysis demonstrates how predictive analytics can enable targeted care management and improve performance under value-based care agreements. By identifying high-risk patients in advance, our team might be able to:\n\nReduce preventable admissions and emergency department visits\nAllocate care coordination resources more efficiently\nQuantify and track impact on total cost of care\nAlign operational priorities with population health goals\n\nThe risk model provides a scalable foundation for tiered interventions, prospective outreach, and continuous ROI measurement—all aligned with the analytics and leadership responsibilities of the AVP role.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis project highlights a practical and scalable approach to value-based performance optimization. If I were serving this team with access to real patient data, this framework could be piloted and adapted to Ochsner’s specific contracts, care models, and operational realities.\nI look forward to your consideration and talking soon."
